# Wordpress woocommerce subscription list

## Functionality 

✔ Retrieve Subscriber Data: Fetch all the subscriber lists from Wordpress database. The data should include relevant fields such as Subscriber Name, Email, Subscription Date, Status, Next Payment date etc.

✔ Render Table: Use HTML and a frontend framework/library to render the data in a table format.

✔ Pagination/Sorting: Consider adding pagination and sorting functionality to make it easier to navigate large data sets.

✔ Search Functionality: Implement a search bar above the table to filter subscribers based on specific criteria (e.g., name, email, subscription date).

✔ Button for Export: Place an "Export to XLS" button above or below the table.

✔ Export Logic: When the user clicks the button, generate an XLS file with the current data displayed in the table.

✔ Responsive Design: Ensure that the table and download button are responsive, meaning they adjust well to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

✔ User Experience: Consider using modals or notifications to confirm the export action or inform the user once the file is ready for download.

✔ Validation and Feedback: Add error handling to manage issues like data fetch failures or XLS generation errors. Provide user feedback in case of errors.

✔ Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure the functionality works smoothly across different browsers.

✔ Load Testing: If dealing with large subscriber lists, test the performance impact of loading and exporting data.
